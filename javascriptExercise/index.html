1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
-	arranges to call given function after 2000ms
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
-    it calls the function immediately, rather than waiting the 2000ms!
2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x);
alert(y(2,3));
-  alert 6 two times
3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
function booyah1(){
alert(“BOOYAH!”);
}
function booyah2 () {
setTimeout(function(){ alert("BOOYAH !") }, 2000);
}

4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons for using it)?
Unobtrusive JavaScript is the way of writing JavaScript language in which
    we properly separate Document Content and Script Content thus allowing us to make a clear distinction between them.
    This approach is useful in so many ways as it makes our code less error prone, easy to update and to debug.
